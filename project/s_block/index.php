	<h1>S Block Elements</h1>
	<p>The elements of Group 1 and Group 2 of the modern periodic table are called S-block elements. Two types of s block elements are possible i.e. the elements with one electron (s1) or the elements with two electrons (s2) in their s-subshell.</p>
	<p>S-block comprises 14 elements namely hydrogen (H), lithium (Li), helium (He), sodium (Na), beryllium (Be), potassium (K), magnesium (Mg), rubidium (Rb), calcium (Ca), cesium (Cs), strontium (Sr), francium (Fr), barium (Ba), and radium (Ra).</p>
	<h1>What are S-Block Elements?</h1>
	<p>The s-block elements having only one electron in their s-orbital are called group one or alkali metals whereas the s block elements having two electrons filling their s-orbital are called group two or <a href="http://localhost/project/alkaline-earth">alkaline earth metals.</a></p>
	<p>The electrons present in an atom occupy various sub-orbitals of available energy levels in the order of increasing energy. The last electron of an atom may find itself in either of the s, p, d and f subshells. Accordingly, the elements of the atom having their last valence electron present in the s-suborbital are called the s block elements.</p>

	<h1>Electronic Configuration of S-Block Elements</h1>
	<p>The electronic configuration of S-block elements is explained below,The alkali elements in the s-block consist of a single valence electron in their outermost shell. This outermost electron is loosely held which makes these metals highly electropositive. Due to which they are not available in the free state in nature. The general electronic configurations of s block elements â€“ group 1 are as shown in the table below:</p>

	<h1>Properties of S-Block Elements</h1>
	<p>Both alkali and alkaline earth elements show a regular gradation in their properties among their respective group elements. But the first member of both S block elements, namely, Lithium and Beryllium differ much from the rest of their members but at the same time, they resemble more with the diagonal element present in the next column.</p>
	<h3>The anomaly of these S-block elements is due to;</h3>
	<ol>
		<li><p>Low atomic and ionic size</p></li>
		<li><p>Greater charge density (charge/volume of the atom)</p></li>
		<li><p>Greater polarization</p></li>
		<li><p>Absence of d-orbitals.</p></li>
	</ol>
	<p>Greater polarization of s block elements makes the first element more covalent and differentiates them from the rest which are ionic.The similarity in size and charge density makes them resemble the element diagonally placed in the next group (diagonal relationship).</p>
	<p>It is observed that the physical and chemical properties of these s block elements change in a particular trend as the atomic number of the elements increases. Changes in the various properties of the group are as mentioned below:</p>
	<h1>Chemical Properties of S-Block Elements</h1>
	<h1>Atomic and Ionic Radii</h1>
	<p>When the s block elements of the modern periodic table are observed it is seen that the size of the alkali metals is larger compared to other elements in a particular period. As the atomic number increases the total number of electrons increases along with the addition of shells.</p>
	<p>On moving down the group the atomic number increases. As a result, the atomic and ionic radius of the alkali metals increases.</p>

	</center>
	<h1>Ionization Enthalpy</h1>
	<p>As we go down the group the size of the atoms increases due to which the attraction between the nucleus and the electrons in the outermost shell decreases. As a result, the ionization enthalpy decreases. The ionization enthalpy of the alkali metals is comparatively lesser than other elements.</p>
	<h1>Physical Properties of S-Block elements</h1>
	<ul>
		<li><p>In the S block elements, the density of the alkali metals increases down the group. Exception: the density of potassium is less than the density of sodium.</p></li>
		<li><p>The alkali metals have a low melting and boiling point due to the weak metallic bonding.</p></li>
		<li><p>Alkali metals and their respective salts have the capability to impart colour to the oxidizing flame due to the heat generated from the flame which excites the valence electrons from one energy level to another energy level. This helps in the detection of alkali metals during the flame test.</p></li>
